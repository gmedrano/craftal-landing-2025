# Craftal Landing Page PRD

## Purpose

To design and launch a high-converting, story-driven landing page for Craftal that resonates with technical founders, product teams, and AI-forward design thinkers. The goal is to convey Craftal’s unique value as a system for building full product ecosystems, not just isolated apps.

### 4. Feature Highlights (x3)

Each feature block includes:

- Headline
- 1-paragraph benefit-oriented copy

Use the Workflow Canvas to model your app’s screens, states, logic, and transitions — all from one AI-powered interface.

Your product spec becomes a shared source of truth — synced with Figma, Jira, and VS Code.

Start with a prompt. Watch it turn into visual flows, specs, and prototype-ready logic.
