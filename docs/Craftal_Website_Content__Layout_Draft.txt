**Craftal** is the AI-native product design platform for modeling and building
**entire product ecosystems**, not just apps.

animated nodes showing connected states (representing BD + PM + PD + EN
working in sync).

## Why Craftal?
| 🌐 | Build Ecosystems, Not Screens |
|----|-------------------------------|
| 🔀 | Align Business, Product & Code |
| 🤖 | Designed for GenAI-Native Workflows |
Each pillar should have:
- 1-sentence summary
- Icon or visual block
Suggested Visuals:
A DSL “document” with arrows to Jira, Figma, and VS Code icons
(bidirectional sync).
Craftal Website Content & Layout Draft 1
A looping flow that touches PM → PD → EN → QA → back to BD.
Section: The Problem
## Teams Work in Silos. Craftal Unifies Them.
Modern product teams depend on shared understanding — but business logic
is scattered across roadmaps, design tools, dev tickets, and docs.
Craftal acts as a **shared semantic canvas** where PMs, designers, and engi
neers model, align, and ship together.
Suggested Illustration: Diagram from deck showing siloed outputs (e.g. static UI
in PD, acceptance criteria in PM, regression test in QA) and disconnected arrows.
Section: The Craftal Solution
## Introducing the Business Domain Modeling Canvas
Craftal centralizes how teams define and evolve the business domain — the s
hared source of truth behind every requirement, interaction, and feature.
Using AI-generated, editable DSL blueprints, teams:
- Translate business rules into structured flows
- Generate and sync outputs with their tools (Jira, Figma, etc.)
- Align around shared logic in real-time
Suggested Visual: Screenshot or stylized mock of the AI-generated business rule
→ transformed into: Jira story, Figma screen, roadmap item (from the “$450
discount” slide).

## What Makes Craftal Unique?
### 🧠 A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Product Thinking
Craftal’s DSL describes features, user flows, logic, and product intent in a stru
ctured way — interpretable by humans and AI.
### 🧩 A Visual Workflow Canvas
An interactive system blueprint made of abstracted screens, states, and user
actions — designed for collaboration across roles.
### 🔁 Bidirectional Tool Syncing
From Jira to Figma to VS Code, Craftal syncs intent and output across your st
ack using its DSL as the bridge.
### 🤖 GenAI at the Core
Craftal’s agents help generate structure, validate gaps, and visualize impact in
seconds — reducing friction and back-and-forth.
Suggested Visual: Split grid with icon and brief text for each. Canvas illustration
in center, DSL doc as the data spine.
Section: Use Case Example (1-column layout)
## From Business Rule to Product Ecosystem
"Customers spending more than $450 on the same transaction should be rew
arded with a 20% discount to stimulate sales."
➡ Turns into:
- A user story in your Jira backlog
- A growth initiative in Aha
- A pricing logic test in your QA suite
- A UX change in your Figma wireframes

FAQ (accordion format)
## Frequently Asked Questions
**What makes Craftal different from tools like Figma or Builder?**
Craftal isn’t just for wireframes or mockups. It models the logic, flows, and int
erconnected intent behind the UI — using a semantic DSL that bridges design,
dev, and product.
**Is this a design tool or a dev tool?**
It’s both — and neither. It’s a shared intelligence layer that integrates with the t
ools you already use.
**How does Craftal use AI?**
GenAI helps generate, evaluate, and suggest changes across your product’s fl
ow — making it easier to structure ideas, test variations, and spot gaps.
**When can I use it?**
Request early access above — the DSL Generator is already working, and the
Workflow Canvas is in active development.
